# Application Name

TODO: In this repository I created three different pages: Google Search, Google Images, and Google Advanced Search. I tried to replicate the aesthetics of Google as much as possible.


## Getting Started

TODO:
1. Create 3 HTML files
2. Start creating forms on each page (text entry and submit button) and link these to its corresponding Google query
3. Connect my own 3 pages with buttons that link to one another
4. Creating stylesheets
	* First: create a .scss file
		* Create fixed style features by using $
		* Create some %blocks of code that I can extend and repeat over by using @extend
		* Create different classes and use @extend when needed
	* Make sure to automatically save changes to CSS file (in terminal)
5. Link CSS stylesheet to pages
6. Link to different classes of CSS stylesheet (inline HTML)
